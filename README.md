# SharpHIDX

**SharpHIDX** is a collection of tools, based on my original [PowerShell PoCs](https://github.com/O-MG/O.MG-Firmware/tree/stable/tools/HIDX/powershell) for HIDX StealthLink, written in C#.
 HIDX StealthLink is a feature introduced by [Mischief Gadgets](https://o.mg.lol/) for the Elite series of the well known [O.MG devices](https://shop.hak5.org/collections/mischief-gadgets).

Users get the ability to exfiltrate data or files over HID instead of the classic and known methods like over network or mass storage.
Apart from exfiltration, a shell like, bi-directional connection is also possible, resulting in remote access to the target.

Part of this repository are:
- HIDXfil: Exfiltration of (clipboard)data and files
- HIDXShell: Remote access
